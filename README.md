## 📌 Overview
This project develops a **decision-support system** for agricultural planning by integrating:
- Multi-source agricultural data analysis
- Predictive modeling for crop yield optimization
- Knowledge graphs for farming best practices

## ✨ Key Features
- **Hybrid AI Approach**: Combines ML models with expert knowledge rules
- **Crop-Specific Models**: Custom algorithms for different crop types
- **Climate Adaptation**: Weather pattern integration for irrigation planning
- **Interpretable AI**: Explainable recommendations for farmers

## 🛠 Technical Components
| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| Data Ingestion | Aggregates soil, weather, and market data |
| Feature Engine | Creates temporal/spatial features |
| Model Zoo | Random Forest, XGBoost, and custom hybrids |
| Knowledge Graph | Ontology-based reasoning (OWL/RDF) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

🌾 Sample Usage
from agri_model import HybridPredictor

predictor = HybridPredictor.load('models/crop_yield_predictor.pkl')
recommendations = predictor.generate_plan(
    soil_ph=6.2, 
    rainfall=[120, 80, 60], 
    crop_type="maize"
)

### Key Highlights:
1. **Agriculture-Focused Formatting** - Uses 🌱 emoji theme and farming terminology
2. **Hybrid AI Emphasis** - Clearly distinguishes between pure ML and knowledge-enhanced components
3. **Practical Integration** - Shows sample usage with real agricultural parameters
4. **Performance Benchmarking** - Comparative table for model selection

Recommended additions:
1. **Screenshots** of Jupyter notebook visualizations
2. **Dataset Sources** with links to public agricultural data
3. **Deployment Guide** for farm management systems
4. **Case Study** example with real-world impact metrics

Would you like me to:
1. Add specific installation details for agricultural libraries?
2. Include a sample notebook output?
3. Create a farmer-friendly usage guide section?
